            <h2>Documented War Crimes</h2>
            <p>The recent escalation of violence in Gaza has led to numerous war crimes, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bombing of al-Ahli Baptist Hospital:</strong> On October 17, 2023, this attack resulted in the deaths of at least 471 civilians, including many women and children, and hundreds were injured. The bombing shocked the world and highlighted the indiscriminate nature of the violence.</li>
                <li><strong>Destruction of Refugee Camps:</strong> In Rafah, refugee camps have come under fire, displacing families multiple times. Families have been forced to flee from their temporary shelters, leaving them vulnerable and without basic necessities.</li>
                <li><strong>Use of White Phosphorus:</strong> The use of white phosphorus in heavily populated areas is a serious concern. This substance causes severe burns and is banned in civilian areas under international law.</li>
                <li><strong>Attacks on Medical Facilities:</strong> The bombing of hospitals, including Shifa Hospital, has left many without access to medical care. Facilities are struggling to operate without electricity, medicine, or adequate staff due to the ongoing blockade.</li>
                <li><strong>Targeting Civilians:</strong> Many reports indicate that residential areas have been targeted, resulting in significant civilian casualties. The high number of deaths, including children, underscores the devastating impact of the conflict.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These actions represent grave violations of international humanitarian law and raise serious questions about accountability for war crimes.</p>
